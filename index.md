Taken from my KitaBisa post (https://kitabisa.com/campaign/bantuavmjey)

I'm Edwin, I'm the papa of Jayden who is currently 6 years old. Currently Jayden has an AVM in his brain. And recently there was bleeding due to an AVM in his brain. Even though for the past 6 years, Jayden hasn't seen any symptoms at all


Last November 1, 2021, at 7 pm when I was going to pick up my wife, it was reported that Jayden suddenly cried unnaturally. Then Jayden convulsed, and suddenly went limp, was called and didn't respond.

We rushed to the nearest hospital, Family Pluit Hospital and were told that his condition was not good and he should be rushed to a bigger hospital. Then we rushed to Atma Jaya Pluit Hospital, and after an MRI procedure, it was discovered that Jayden had bleeding in his head that was pressing on the brain.

The doctor advised us to immediately take surgery, we also agreed with the doctor's advice. That night Jayden was operated on. After that Jayden was treated in the PICU for 1 week to make sure his critical condition passed and was stable again.

After regaining consciousness, Jayden was unable to move his left side due to the previous bleeding. After stabilizing, Jayden was moved to a regular room, and underwent MRI, MRA, MRV checks. At that time the AVM was not visible. The doctor suggested performing CT Angiography or even DSA  to find out the main cause of the bleeding in Jayden's head.


On December 7, 2021, we took DSA action for Jayden and it was discovered that he had an AVM in a part of his brain that could swell and rupture at any time. The doctor advised to perform the Gamma Knife procedure because the position of the AVM is rather deep and difficult to reach with surgery

1-2 November 2021, Jayden has surgery on the head to take the bleeding. His skull was then deposited in the right abdomen due to swelling after the bleeding was still there.

November 2-7, 2021, Jayden is hospitalized in the PICU to pass his critical period, given anti-seizure medication, and make sure the bleeding doesn't come back.


November 7-14, 2021, Jayden was admitted to a regular inpatient ward. Jayden is also required to undergo physiotherapy to ensure the condition of his left side of the body can return to normal

December 6-8, 2021, Jayden was admitted for DSA action to determine the main cause of his head haemorrhage. And from his time in PICU until now, Jayden is still undergoing outpatient treatment and routine physiotherapy

Jayden is a cheerful kid, very talkative. But Jayden really cares about the environment around him.

Jayden is also a child who wants to work hard to learn and help those around him.

He often offers to help his mom and dad clean the house and cook. He also likes to chat, joke, and have fun with those around him.

Jayden is also very interested in learning science, always wants to know about new things, and likes to do experiments.

Jayden is still passionate about training his hands and feet. Jayden often says "Jayden wants to be like before, wants to run, wants to swim, wants to play in the sand, wants to go for a walk, wants to watch upstairs"

The current cost is approximately 500 million

We are still searching for information regarding the cost of the Gamma Knife action. The amount obtained from the RSCM is around 250 million rupiah 

Then it will be necessary to do another DSA to make sure the AVM is completely finished, this will cost 50 million

And action will be required to reattach Jayden's skull at an estimated cost of 200 million

And there are still costs for medicines, lab tests, and other unexpected costs

To be honest, we are not a very needy family, but this situation made us very surprised, especially since this condition is not a condition that can be covered by any insurance (because AVM is a blood vessel disorder from birth). BPJS also does not bear the cost for this Gamma Knife because the costs are very expensive.

Most of the savings we have have been used for surgery to remove Jayden's bleeding and DSA. And we don't have much savings left for further actions.

We are doing our best to give Jayden a better future. Our hope is the same as Jayden's hope "to be able to go back to how it used to be" where Jayden can carry out his normal activities.
